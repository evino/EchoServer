# Echo Server

Simple echo server written in C. Main purpose of
this project was to learn how to use TCP/IP
sockets, and interact with them in a simple
client-server architecture.

## Files
1. `server.c`
    - Contains server side code that gets compiled
    into an executable named `server`
2. `client.c`
    - Contains client side code that gets compiled
    into an executable named `client`

## Compilation
Source code will be compiled using the provided
make file. Simply running `make` inside
`EchoServer` directory will build all executables.
Can also just build `server` and `client` targets
seperately if you wish.
